# fullstack-coding-challenge
Coding challenge for senior developers

<p>Imagine you are in a company who has website where people can submit their videos and they can then slice the video in order for them turn them into GIFs. You are the software engineer responsible for building this</p>

<p>Design a webpage where the user can upload a video. After uploading, the user can input time ranges of the video that they want to slice into GIFs. The user must be able to input multiple time ranges. Once the user is happy with the number of gifs they want to create, they must be able to click submit. The system must be able to process this request and slice the video at the defined time intervals. The outout must be slices of the video that the user chose to turn into gifs. The user must be able to save the videos they created so that they can come back and see them later. </p>


<p>When the user saves their GIFs, they must submit a form with their details such as <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>username</strong>, <strong>secret password</strong>. They must be able to come back to the webpage and retireve thir submitted videos using the username and password</p>


<strong>The webpage must have the following flow:</strong> 

<ol>
  <li>The user visits the webpage and is presented with an interface which has a file upload field</li>
  <li>After uploading the file, the user can submit the file</li>
  <li>After submission, user can slice the video at mulitple timestamps</li>
  <li>After the user is happy with the timestamps, they can submit the times where the video is to be sliced</li>
  <li>After submission, the user must be presented with the sliced sections of the video for them to see. They must be able to download those sections</li>
  <li>Then the user must have a button which allows them to save results</li>
  <li>Whent he user chooses to save the results so that they can come back to the homepage and find their GIF slices</li>
  <li>When the user chooses to save the results, they must be taken to a form where they can choose their username and a secret passphrase that allows them to search for their slices from the homepage</li>
  </ol>
